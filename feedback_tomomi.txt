2. Things you liked
It was helpful to do a quick review of command line. I donâ€™t use command line in my work. I would have been lost without the review.

3. Area for improvement
The class was great. Some of the example work flow demo was very helpful. I would like to play with it more, then like to learn more about the different teamwork flows with real examples.
